# GitHub Pages
##

# This .gitignore is appropriate for repositories deployed to GitHub Pages and using
# a Gemfile as specified at https://github.com/github/pages-gem#conventional

# Basic Jekyll gitignores (synchronize to Jekyll.gitignore)
_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata

# Additional Ruby/bundler ignore for when you run: bundle install
/vendor

# Specific ignore for GitHub Pages
# GitHub Pages will always use its own deployed version of pages-gem
# This means GitHub Pages will NOT use your Gemfile.lock and therefore it is
# counterproductive to check this file into the repository.

# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
